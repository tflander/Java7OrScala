After-Market Parts:  Java / Scala Interoperability
--------------------------------------------------

This example shows how easy it is to integrate Scala and Java within a JVM.  You can consider Scala as simply another Java jar file included in your project.

The first example is Java tests over a Scala API.  This demonstrates that if you get scared of Scala, you can take off your big-boy pants and go back to Scala.

The second example is more relevant.  If you have Java code that works, you can just use it in Scala.  Don't re-write the code in Scala unless the re-write create value.  You can also start using Scala as a testing framework over Java.

- Open the four links from the Readme.  Note the cross-refererencing between Scala and Java
- Review the Scala test over the Java API (possible evolution path)
- Review the Java test over the Scala API (alternate evolution path)
  - Note that you might not want implicit conversions to Scala collections
