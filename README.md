Java7OrScala
============

Overview
--------
This project supports a presentation for exposing the pain of Java.  It contains code examples written in both Scala and Java.  Observe how much cleaner the Scala code is compared to Java.  Although 3rd party Java libraries exist to clean up awkward Java code, it seems more fair to compare core Java7 to core Scala.


The Examples
------------
Musical Fruit:  Beans (aka Value Objects, Data Transfer Objects)
Only the Lonely:  Singletons
To Be or Not To Be: Optional Things
Hollywood:  Inversion of control
Cake Boss: List Decorating
Family Ties: Polymorphic Behavior
After-Market Parts:  Java / Scala Interoperability
Censorship:  Filtering data
Mob Rule:  Grouping data
