Musical Fruit:  Beans (aka Value Objects, Data Transfer Objects)
----------------------------------------------------------------

There is a lot of overhead for java beans, especially if you want to handle equals() and have a pretty toString().  Since scala case classes give you this behavior out-of-the box, it was only fair that the behavior is reproduced in the java bean.  Most of this example comes from the work of Venkat Subramaniam.  He says people often object that their IDE can generate most of the boilerplate code necessary for defining beans in Java.  Venkat refers to this as "IDE vomit", when you need an IDE to vomit out code that you need to make the compiler happy.

- Review the Java test
- Show the Scala test.  Observe all the tests are the same, but the syntax is nicer.
- Review the Java class
- Review the Scala class against the test.

Only the Lonely:  Singletons
----------------------------

Another example based on the work of Venkat Subramaniam.  He describes the Singleton pattern in Java as a pattern that takes one hour to learn and six months to debug.

In addtion to demonstrating safe lazy initialization of a singleton, this example demonstrates safe lazy instantiation of member variables.

- Open the four links from the Readme.
- Review the Java code (the test is not interesting)
- Review the Scala code.  Note that there are two singletons in one source file.

To Be or Not To Be: Optional Things
-------------------------------------

Scala has an easy answer to a common problem in Java.  Bugs in Java often appear as a thrown NullPointerException.  This occurs when a developer does not expect a null referece to an object, but it happens.  Scala's easy answer is to never use null to represent optional data.  While there are patterns in Java to avoid nulls, it seems more fair for the example code to show the more common approach of adding null checks.

Hollywood:  Inversion of control
--------------------------------

A common programming task is to take a generic API and wrap it for a specific purpose.  Also, many API's require some kind of initialization and/or tear-down that could be mishandled.  Programmers mitigate this risk through inversion of control.  

This example takes a very simple API and hides the initialization and tear-down.  The original api is written in Java.  There are api wrappers written in both scala and java.  This example illustrates two approaches to api wrapping.  The first approach is an api scripting approach where you can script multiple calls to a properly initialized API, then have tear-down happen from the scripting engine.  The second approach allows you to execute a block of logic against a properly initialized API, then have tear-down happen from the API wrapper.

For both approaches (scripting and block calls), we create a polymorphic Java model.  For scala, however, no object model is necessary.  You can script calls to the api using parameter place holders, and you can exucute an anonomous block of code be passing it to the API wrapper as a function.  This eliminates the need to create concrete classes in a polymorphic model just to pass code to the API wrapper.

Cake Boss: List Decorating
--------------------------

This example shows how you can use out-of-the-box list formatting in Scala.  It also shows how you can extend this formatting for your specific needs.  This example also uses the "monkey-patching/duck-punching" technique to attach custom formatting methods to the base List class.

- Open the four links from the Readme.
- Review the Scala tests for out of the box behavior
- Review the Java Code for the pretty list displayer.
- Review the Scala Code for the pretty list displayer.
- Review the Scala Monkey Patching test.

Family Ties: Polymorphic Behavior
-----------------------------------

This example demonstrates how useful it can be to package up related code into a single source code file.  Most of the code in the Java example is boilerplate code.  Boilerplate code is code that is necessary for the compiler, but not necessary to express the intent of the developer's design.  This example also demonstrates scala functions as first-class objects.

- Open the four links from the Readme.
- Note the different files in Java for the polymorphic model.

After-Market Parts:  Java / Scala Interoperability
--------------------------------------------------

This example shows how easy it is to integrate Scala and Java within a JVM.  You can consider Scala as simply another Java jar file included in your project.

The first example is Java tests over a Scala API.  This demonstrates that if you get scared of Scala, you can take off your big-boy pants and go back to Scala.

The second example is more relevant.  If you have Java code that works, you can just use it in Scala.  Don't re-write the code in Scala unless the re-write create value.  You can also start using Scala as a testing framework over Java.

- Open the four links from the Readme.  Note the cross-refererencing between Scala and Java
- Review the Scala test over the Java API (possible evolution path)
- Review the Java test over the Scala API (alternate evolution path)
  - Note that you might not want implicit conversions to Scala collections

Censorship:  Filtering data
---------------------------

Re-creating this filter example in Java was boring, so I didn't do it.  Filtering in Scala is simple enought (but powerful), so I didn't bother creating a utility in main.  We can just look at the test.
