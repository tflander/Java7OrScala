Only the Lonely:  Singletons
----------------------------

Another example based on the work of Venkat Subramaniam.  He describes the Singleton pattern in Java as a pattern that takes one hour to learn and six months to debug.

In addtion to demonstrating safe lazy initialization of a singleton, this example demonstrates safe lazy instantiation of member variables.

- Open the four links from the Readme.
- Review the Java code (the test is not interesting)
- Review the Scala code.  Note that there are two singletons in one source file.
