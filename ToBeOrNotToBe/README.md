To Be or Not To Be: Optional Things
-------------------------------------

Scala has an easy answer to a common problem in Java.  Bugs in Java often appear as a thrown NullPointerException.  This occurs when a developer does not expect a null referece to an object, but it happens.  Scala's easy answer is to never use null to represent optional data.  While there are patterns in Java to avoid nulls, it seems more fair for the example code to show the more common approach of adding null checks.

- Open the four links from the Readme.
- Review the Java test 
- Show the Scala test.  Observe all the tests are the same, but the syntax is nicer.
- Compare the Scala and Java code.
